Steps to create the environment in AWS:

Step 1:
  Go to Code Build -> Get Started
     -> Provide name, default project
     -> Provide source provider code where it exists (Github), public repository, repository URL
     -> Add the Buildspec, by adding the buildspec file name from our code files, Create CodeBuild Project ("We can notification also here")

We need to run the CodeBuild in CodePipeline

Step 2:
  Go to CodePipeline -> Get Started
     -> Build CustomPipeline, provide pipeline name, queued mode,  next
     -> Provide Source provider(Github via App), click connect to Github -> provide cnt name, provide githubname, code repositoryname, and branch name,  next
     -> Other build providers - select CodeBuild, select projectname,  next, next, and create Pipeline
