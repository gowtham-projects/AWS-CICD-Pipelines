Steps to create the environment in AWS:

Step 1:
  Go to Code Build -> Get Started
     -> Provide name, default project
     -> Provide source provider code where it exists (Github), public repository, repository URL
     -> Add the Buildspec, by adding the buildspec file name from our code files, Create CodeBuild Project ("We can create a notification alert here")

We need to run the CodeBuild in CodePipeline

Step 2:
  Go to CodePipeline -> Get Started
     -> Build CustomPipeline, provide pipeline name, queued mode,  next
     -> Provide Source provider(Github via App), click connect to Github -> provide cnt name, provide githubname, code repositoryname, and branch name,  next
     -> Other build providers - select CodeBuild, select projectname,  next, next, and create Pipeline

   * CodeBuild -> After build, the file will be available in the S3 Bucket
   * CodeDeploy -> It needs to take file from S3 Bucket and Provide to -> EC2 Instance

Step 3:
  To take a file from an S3 Bucket, it needs permissions.
     -> Create IAM Role(without providing AWS config access keys) for EC2, attach policies S3 Permissions,amazonEC2RoleforCodeDeploy attach this IAM Role to EC2 Instance.
  We need to install Code Deploy Agent in the EC2 Instance(Check - Install Code Deploy Agent, AWS documentation is there):
     -> create script (vim agent.sh), run (sh agent.sh)    
     -> do all things and do a status check

Step 4:
  Go to CodeDeploy -> Get Started
     ->
