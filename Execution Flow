Steps to create the environment in AWS:

Step 1:
  Go to Code Build -> Get Started
     -> Provide name, default project
     -> Provide source provider code where it exists (Github), public repository, repository URL
     -> Add the Buildspec, by adding the buildspec file name from our code files, Create CodeBuild Project ("We can create a notification alert here")

We need to run the CodeBuild in CodePipeline

Step 2:
  Go to CodePipeline -> Get Started
     -> Build CustomPipeline, provide pipeline name, queued mode,  next
     -> Provide Source provider(Github via App), click connect to Github -> provide cnt name, provide githubname, code repositoryname, and branch name,  next
     -> Other build providers - select CodeBuild, select projectname,  next, next, and create Pipeline

   * CodeBuild -> After build, the file will be available in the S3 Bucket
   * CodeDeploy -> It needs to take file from S3 Bucket and Provide to -> EC2 Instance

Step 3:
  EC2 Permissions - To retrieve a file from an S3 Bucket, it requires specific permissions.
     -> Create IAM Role(without providing AWS config access keys) for EC2, attach policies S3 Permissions,amazonEC2RoleforCodeDeploy attach this IAM Role to EC2 Instance.
  We need to install Code Deploy Agent in the EC2 Instance(Check - Install Code Deploy Agent, AWS documentation is there):
     -> create script (vim agent.sh), run (sh agent.sh)    
     -> do all things and do a status check

Step 4:
  Go to CodeDeploy -> Get Started
     -> Provide application name, select deployment platform (EC2), and create application.
     -> Code Deploy needs permissions - It needs to take an S3 file and deploy in EC2, create IAM Role for CodeDeploy & attach S3, EC2 policies
    --> Create a Deployment group, provide a name, select the created IAM Role, EC2 environment - add key & value, disable LB, create Deployment group

Step 5:
  Go to CodePipeline -> In CodePipeline IAM Role, verify that CodeBuild and CodeDeploy have the necessary permissions. If not, attach it.
    -> Edit Pipeline, add/create Deploy Stage after Build - provide name, add action group - provide name, action provider - codedeploy, 
                      Input artifact - source artifact, select app name, deployment group, done, save it.
 Note: Check and provide the CodeDeploy policy in the CodePipelineService Role for successful deployment to EC2.

==> Start Release changes, it will start from source, build, and deploy to succeed.

==> In the future, if a developer commits any changes to the Source(Git). It automatically runs from source -> build -> deploy to production.
